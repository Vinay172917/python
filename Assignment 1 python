## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
ans= Because by using python we can do different things like web development,data sorting,also it has libraries to understand and syntex is also simple for begineers.
Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans= Beacaus it helps to reduce the repeated function calls and hence to be faster and more effective than the recursive and divide approaches.
Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans= Web development,Data science, Gaming etc.
Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans-A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it.we dont need to declare them before using them and there type.
Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans= yes we can take an input from the user.
Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans= Integer
Q8. What is type casting?
Ans= in type casting we cant convert datatype to other datatype.like int to float or vice-versa.
Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans=No.
Q10. What are keywords?
Ans= Keywords are reserved words used in Python programming that have special meanings to the compiler. We cannot use a keyword as a variable name
Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans= We cannot use a keyword as a variable name.example like keyword (if) we use as variable then it doesnt give value which we gonna assign.
Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans= using print statements
Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans=all the algebric also concatenate,greter then less then, boolen.
Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans= /- Float division, //- Integer division
Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```
Ans = code
stringmul='iNeuron'*4
print(stringmul)

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.
Ans= Code
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  
if (num % 2) == 0:  
   print("{0} is Even number".format(num))  
else:  
   print("{0} is Odd number".format(num)) 

Q18. What are boolean operator?
Ans=  And, or , not are the boolean operators.

Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0=1

0 and 0=0

True and False and True= false
1 or 0 or 0=1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?
Ans=conditional statements that allow you to control the flow of your program based on conditions that you specify.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?
Ans= to control the flow of your program based on conditions that you specify
Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".
Ans= code
age=45
if age>= 18:
    print("I can vote")
elif age< 18:
    print("I can't vote")
else:
    print(error)
Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.
Ans=code-
num1=int(input())
num2=int(input())
num3=int(input())

if num1>=num2 and num1>=num3:
    print("num1 is greatest")
elif num2>=num1 and num2>=num3:
    print("num2 is greatest")
else: 
     print("num3 is greatest")


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
Ans = cant get this .
